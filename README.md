# x80Hao-CPU
This is our CPU design project from CS 382 - Computer Architecture and Organization at Stevens Institute of Technology.
For this project we created a CPU, an assembly language to accompany the architecture, and an assembler.
See 'CS 382 Project.pdf' to read about the infrastructure and how to use the CPU.
